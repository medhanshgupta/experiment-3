aim: Study of Tuple in Python

theory: In this experiment we learned how to use tuple in python. 
Tuples are immutable, i.e. they cannot be edited. 
Tuple use () brackets. 
print(tpl[1]) displays the 2nd element of the tuple. 
print(tpl[1:4]) displays the 2nd, 3rd and 4th element of the tuple.
tpl7+=tpl8 adds element of tpl8 to tpl7 but changes the memory location of the tuple tpl7.
sorted(tuple) sorts the tuple in ascending order.
tpl=(10,)*5 , printing this will print the value 10 five times.
id(tpl) , printing this will display the memory location of the tuple.

algorithm: 

conclusion: Hence tuples were implemented in python and operations were done on them.
